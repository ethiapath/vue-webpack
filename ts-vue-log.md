Ok I'm going to try and document my process for once.

Honestly just having a text file open where I paste links throughout my googlings 
would be incredibly valuble!

I want to make a music app on the web

I drew some desings, but esentially I'm recreating ableton live.
Speaking of design. I think it'd be cool to use some neumorphism

To start I want to impliment the detail device view.

I did some inital research that was pretty fruitful
I'll post links here

I also need to find those web audio examples I was reading on my phone.


THen maybe a link to the guy who integrated web audio into a vue component


SO I just cloned this vue with typescript project from microsoft
https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Vue-Starter

Using vue I'm able to choose the best web tech!
vue + ts + scss + pug

I think this set makes nice clean looking code on the web

I'll have to learn pug (I might switch to normal html), but scss is just sass with no brackets

I also wanted a project with webpack exposed so I could learn that and integrate diffrent tech.
Like wasm... More on that later :)


# Setup webpack dev server

I'm gonna try and follow this guide
https://linguinecode.com/post/how-to-setup-webpack-dev-server-react-babel

simplist webpack config (need to test)
```js
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, './dist'),
    publicPath: '/dist/',
    filename: 'build.js'
  },
  devServer: {
    contentBase: path.join('dist'),
    compress: false,
    hot: true,
    port: 3000,
    publicPath: '/',
  },
}
```

THis guy took a screen shot of his npm install command ðŸ™„
or it was just in a weird code block that wasn't copyable? 
```
npm i --save-dev html-webpack-plugin webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
```

Running into webpack issues
```

Just had to add the css loader :)
